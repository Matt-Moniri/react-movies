# Homework Feedback


## Things you did well

- Nice Job using react router to add multi page functionality to your app
- You seem to have a good understanding of how to use nested routing in your app

## Suggestions for improvements 
- While it is good that you have separated your project into seperate folders you should focus on the naming of those folders. Right now you have folders such as detail, list and main. This makes it hard for people who don't know much about the project

## Overview 
Excellent job on completing all the homework in the course, looking forward to seeing your final project **Score (3/3)**
